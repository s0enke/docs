* Create the pull request as soon as possible.
* Name the branch after the following format: (feature|bugfix|hotfix|enhancement)/[issue-number]-<description>
  * the issue number is optional, but should always be provided if there is an issue
* Add a label for the type of the PR (Feature, Bugfix, Hotfix, Enhancement)
* Add a label for the state of the PR
  * in progress if you are still working on the PR
  * review when it is reviewable
  * feedback if you have reviewed someone else's PR
  * alternatively you can also use the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/sulu-cmf/sulu)
* Template is devided in two parts: Tasks (for developer), Informations (for reviewer)
* Tasks list can be extended for developer tasks
